# As an Employer

## You should

- Have a good ratio of male and female developers
- Be comitted to a diverse workplace and actively try to ensure a diverse workforce
- Have 'soft' work a developer can do when they are not in the right frame of mind to code
- Have a fair, transparent salary system
- Engage in team-building, for example paid hack-days, paid for team meals
- Allow time off for healthcare appointments
- Allow remote working
- Provide staff with ergonomic workstations

## Must not

- Have a 'dudebro' culture
- Have 0 female developers
- Pay one developer more than another outside of a transparent system, for example pay grades with steps up based on time & experience with the company
  - Many Women tend to negotiate for lower salaries than their Male counterparts. To me, having open and transparent salaries means that you will be paying your workforce equally.
